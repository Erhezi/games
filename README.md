### Stroop Effect
This Stroop's Game is a classic neuropsychological test used to assess our brains' ability to inhibit cognitive interference when a mismatch in stimuli and task occurs.
<br>
To run the game's script ***Stroop.py***, first install pygame (assume python3 is already there): 
> pip install pygame

Then just run the script and follow the instruction in terminal.

> python3 Stoop.py

<br>
After initialized, in terminal, first custom difficulty settiings include two dimensions:
- number of colors (4, 5, 6, 7) used in the test
- difficulty mode (easy, normal) where easy mode make sure the top card always displayed in blacks
<br>
The timer are currently set at 20s, usually your brain will need approximately 20% more time to react when played under normal mode compared to easy.

My little wonderings on inhibitory circuit, sleep deprivation, and depression: you get sleep deprivated and your brain gets high, after sometime your brain just realized that it need some good rest then inhibitory circuit get upregulated. Well, so far nothing happens, but under sleep depreviation, brain lost its abitlity to tune down the inhibitory responses or your synapses just become less responsive, now Oops ... eveything just turn into the opposite of getting high?
